# PROG2 - Correction for the second exam

I know, it wasn't all that easy, but, hey, you learn from it. Some of you got the classes right, but didn't have enough time to complete the rest of the methods. So I thought I'd give you a proposition on how it should be. 

## Q1 : can we turn that interface into an abstract class ? 

You absolutely can, though, keep in mind, a class can at most extend from one superclass, not two, while you can implement multiple interfaces in a single class. 

## Q2 : why should we generalize Room, Hotel and Park ? 

Well they do have some things in common so it's pretty normal. They are all the items that can be reviewed.
